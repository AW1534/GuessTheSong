# Guess the song
*A small project by Andrew Wiltshire, for a school project*

# Note
yes, the code sucks. could've utilised JSON more, used bcrypt to encrypt passwords, MongoDB for the user database...

But usually i dont code in python without a framework (discord.py). maybe I'll rewrite this in node.js

# Requirements
- Python 3 (Python 3.10 was used to create this)
- windows, mac, linux or any linux distro that supports the `cls` command
- It is recommended to add python to `PATH`

That's it- no python packages are used here, other than the built-in ones
